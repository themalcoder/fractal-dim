## Fractal Dimension

The main inspiration of this is from *[3Blue1Brown]*(https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw) Video named **Fractals are typically not self-similar**. You can watch the video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB9n2gHsHN4).

I took this Duffing Oscillator as an arbitrary example, any or for most (probaby) of the systems, fractal dimension can be calculated without much effort. Just has to change the systyem and probably fine tune everything else. 

Graphs are generated prgramatically and is saved the **graphs** directory with sub-folders named as set-1, set-2 etc. 

As of now, multiprocessing is not implemented.
